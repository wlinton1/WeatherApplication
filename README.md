# WeatherApplication

In this application we were meant to create a weather application using api calls from openweathermap api. This was fairly difficult for me as we had only two days to get into apis. 

I decided to watch an online tutorial on how to work with apis and creating a weather application. I did this for understanding as the course is fast paced and I needed the extra instruction. 

The application searches weather based on city and has links for both current day and a forecast. These links are in the upper right of the index page. 

I am glad I found tutorials in order to complete this assignment as they brought me much more understanding with current topics within class. The tutorial comes from Udemy.
