# WeatherApplication

# Apologies for getting the app in so late, I have been at my family's houses taking care of a family member. They needed me so I didn't really have a choice, but they live in the mountains up near Julian and the weather there took out the internet. I just got back to my place which is why I am finally able to post it. My instructor said to turn it in anyways and it'll be fine.

In this application we were meant to create a weather application using api calls from openweathermap api. This was fairly difficult for me as we had only two days to get into apis. 

I decided to watch an online tutorial on how to work with apis and creating a weather application. I did this for understanding as the course is fast paced and I needed the extra instruction. 

The application searches weather based on city and has links for both current day and a forecast. These links are in the upper right of the index page. 

I am glad I found tutorials in order to complete this assignment as they brought me much more understanding with current topics within class. The tutorial comes from Udemy.

these are screenshots of the application working but the deployment page will be unable to do this. I will fix it in upcoming days, this is directly from my vscode open in default browser.

link to the deployment page, searching for the weather will be blocked for some reason, I believe it is because of the tutorial I watched it set it up within a local server and I didn't notice. I am unsure really though as I needed the tutorial for help anyways. I just wanted to get the code pushed up to show I have the understanding for this now, and project 1 really helped with all the researching. 

The screenshots show the application working correctly in my vsstudiocode
